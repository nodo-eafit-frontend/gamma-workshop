          irius Black escape occurred shortly after Barty Crouch Jnr, Bellatrix,
          Rodolphus, and Rabastan Lestrange were sentenced to life imprisonment
          for the torture and permanent incapacitation of the Aurors Frank and
          Alice Longbottom. At the trial, Bartemius Crouch Snr, Barty's father,
          was one of the judges. Barty begged his father to set him free, but
          Crouch Snr felt betrayed by his son and thought he deserved to be
          punished and imprisoned. He gave his son a life term in Azkaban. By 31
          July, Black took advantage of his extreme weight loss to slip through
          his cell door in his Animagus dog form. These ten were considered to
          be some of the most dangerous and highly guarded convicts due to their
          crimes being legendary. The escapees were high security prisoners
          being held on the top most floors of the prison and were sentenced to
          life within the walls of the fortress. Most of the escapees, as well
          as a few other Death Eaters life within the walls of the fortress. He gave his son a life term in Azkaban. By 31

          In January 1996, a mass breakout from Azkaban set ten long-imprisoned
          Death Eaters loose. Lord Voldemort had little trouble arranging this,
          as many of the Dementors were happy to oblige his dark whims.Cornelius
          Fudge (who was at the time refusing to believe that Voldemort could
          have returned and leading the Ministry of Magic in a campaign to
          discredit Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter for trying to prove the
          claim) expressed to Harry Potter for trying to prove the claim
          expressed to.

        Eaters from Azkaban, including all the escapees from the 1996 breakout
        who were re-imprisoned after the Ministry break-in, as well as others

        On 1 August, 1997, the Ministry of Magic was taken by the Death Eaters
        and Pius Thicknesse (under the influence of the Imperius Curse) was made
        Minister for Magic. The newly reformed Ministry hosted another mass
        breakout. Those who escaped were falsely cleared and some went on to
        work at the Ministry of Magic. Travers, who had been recaptured in
        August, was a known escapee.
