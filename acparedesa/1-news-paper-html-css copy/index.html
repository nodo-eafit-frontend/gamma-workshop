      Pius Thicknesse (under the influence of the Imperius Curse) was made
      Minister for Magic. The newly reformed Ministry hosted another mass
      breakout. Those who escaped were falsely cleared and some went on to work
      at the Ministry of Magic. Travers, who had been recaptured in August, was
      a known escapee.
