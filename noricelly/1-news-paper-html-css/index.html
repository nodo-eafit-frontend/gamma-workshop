            <b>killer kasady on the run?</b><br>Much of Cletus Kasady's past remains in mystery, but what is given
            suggests a dark, twisted and traumatic past.
            He was born in Brooklyn, New York, where his heart stopped on the day of his birth but he was revived.
            According
            to his claims, he was frequently abused by his parents and grandmother. Although he claims he killed his
            grandmother and mother out of retribution, he also killed his mother’s dog afterwards for seemingly no
            reason,
            implying he had sociopathic tendencies from the start. He also had a father who beat him, which is presumed
            to
            be another reason why Cletus grew up to become a sociopath.

        <p class="p2">Just yesterday Tom Hardy shared the first look at Woody Harrelson as Cletus Kasady in Venom 2, the
            host that ultimately houses the symbiote of Carnage, one of the most feared villains in the universe
            arachnid for his bloodthirsty way of being. Well, now the first video from set has been leaked, in which
            we see Woody participate in a scene in which the reddish symbiote probably appeared to protect
            Cletus from the onslaught of a potential special agent.</p>
